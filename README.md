# üåç LandScope : Land-Type Classification Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Images
## Project Overview
**LandScope** is an AI-driven web platform that utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify land cover types from high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images. The system accurately identifies one of ten predefined land types‚Äîsuch as forest, water bodies, residential zones, and crop fields‚Äîbased on RGB imagery.

In addition to land classification, LandScope enhances user experience by integrating a **search agent (via SerpAPI)** that fetches real-time resources and reports related to the predicted land type. Furthermore, if geographic coordinates are available, the platform displays an **interactive map** showing the location of the uploaded image.

By combining deep learning with intelligent search and geospatial visualization, LandScope provides a powerful and accessible tool for applications in **environmental monitoring**, **urban planning**, **agriculture**, and **disaster management**.

## Project Objectives
‚Ä¢ **Environmental Monitoring:** Detect land cover changes, deforestation, and ecosystem shifts.

‚Ä¢ **Urban Planning:** Monitor urban expansion and support infrastructure optimization.

‚Ä¢ **Agriculture Management:** Identify crop types and assess farmland conditions.

‚Ä¢ **Disaster Response:** Evaluate affected areas to enhance recovery planning.

‚Ä¢ **Automation:** Deliver fast, scalable, and accurate land classification through deep learning.
